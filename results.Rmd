# Executive Summary

Michael Smith (President & CEO of the Greater Valdosta United Way [GVUW]) submitted a draft plan or request for a Needs Assessment Survey to Darrell Moore (Valdosta State University’s [VSU] Director of the South Georgia Center for Regional Impact) in December 2022. Darrell then contacted Drs. Keith Lee and Joseph Robbins (both at VSU) to secure their assistance in designing and analyzing a Needs Assessment survey targeting residents from 11 counties in South Georgia (i.e., Atkinson, Bacon, Berrien, Brooks, Clinch, Coffee, Echols, Jeff Davis, Lanier, Lowndes, and Ware County). Smith explained that his goal for this project was to better understand how the economic and COVID-19 strains have impacted residents in these counties, assess the mental and psychological needs of these residents, and then to identify the nonprofit services being used (or needed) in the GVUW’s service region. The survey was designed and then launched in January 2023 and concluded at the end of April 2023. All told, 1,300 survey responses were received during the survey period thanks to the help of numerous nonprofit organizations, who were instrumental in spreading the word. The rest of this report outlines our survey methodology and subsequent analysis.

# Survey Methodology

The Needs Assessment survey was conducted via VSU’s Qualtrics license and the actual questionnaire included questions on respondent background, what stressors they currently face (mental health, financial, housing, employment, transportation, internet), what nonprofit services they use (or need). Questions on respondents’ emotional and psychological well-being were included as well.

## Selecting the Survey Method

The survey was accessed via a QR code that directed respondents to a Qualtrics-administered survey. These QR codes were available on widely distributed flyers throughout the 11-county target region.

## Developing a Questionnare

The survey questionnaire was designed through consultations between Michael Smith (President & CEO), Susan Nebel (Community Impact Director), Dr. Keith Lee (VSU), and Dr. Joseph Robbins (VSU). The basis for the survey was to identify the general needs of this region and, in particular, the mental health needs and support among South Georgians. We did not collect personally identifying information among respondents as this was unnecessary for the study and as this was part of the IRB compliance process for this project. 

## Selecting the Sample

The universe of the survey is the 11-county service region listed in Figure 1. All residents in these counties were invited and eligible to participate in the survey. Survey responses were unequally distributed throughout this region, however. Combined, these counties are home to around 287,000 residents.[^1]

```

## Conducting the Survey

The survey was publicized in various ways: through GVUW, through GVUW’s  nonprofit partner agencies throughout the 11-county region, by promoting the project through news stories shared by VSU (April 2023) and WALB (February 2023), and by sharing the survey in other various ways. 

## Determining the Results

The results of the Needs Assessment survey have been analyzed in partnership with the stated needs expressed in discussions with the GVUW.
